                <p>The habitable zone, often called the "Goldilocks zone," is the region around a star where temperatures might allow for liquid water, a crucial ingredient for life as we know it. Each star has a unique habitable zone depending on its size and temperature. Hotter stars have wider, more distant zones, while cooler stars have narrower, closer zones. Scientists focus on exoplanets in these zones because they could potentially support life.<br></p>
                <p>However, being in the habitable zone doesn't guarantee a planet is habitable. Factors like atmosphere, surface conditions, and planetary composition are equally important. For example, Venus is within the Sun’s habitable zone but has a runaway greenhouse effect, making it too hot for life. Similarly, Mars is on the edge of the Sun's habitable zone but lacks a thick atmosphere to maintain liquid water on its surface today. <br></p>

                <p>Recent missions, such as NASA’s Kepler and TESS, have found thousands of planets in these zones, and researchers are keen to study their atmospheres to search for signs of life. One of the key goals is to find planets similar to Earth that might have the right conditions for life to thrive.<br></p>
                <p>This search also raises the question of how the concept of habitability might change as we learn more. Could life exist in environments different from Earth’s? Studying planets in the habitable zones of other stars helps broaden our understanding of where life might be found in the universe.<br></p>
